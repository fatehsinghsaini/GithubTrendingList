## API
Since there is no official API for Trending Repositories (it is one of the internal GitHub APIâ€™s),
<br />
I have decided to use [GitHub Search API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-repositories) and sort the repositories by their stars.

  - LiveData - notify domain layer data to views.
  - Lifecycle - dispose of observing data when lifecycle state changes.
  - ViewModel - UI related data holder, lifecycle aware.
  - Navigation Component - handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
  - Data Binding - declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
- Architecture
  - MVVM Architecture (View - DataBinding - ViewModel - Model)
  - Repository pattern
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - loading images.
- [CircleImageView](https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView)-for circle image view
